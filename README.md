# Tradebooks

Tradebooks is a webpage that aids students in buying and selling used books. The site hopes to help students who may be less financially fortunate to get the books they require, as well as graduating students who may no longer need their books.

The site is currently up at: [http://desuderata.pythonanywhere.com/](http://desuderata.pythonanywhere.com/)

## Prerequisites

The website is built on:

[Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/)

[Django 2.2.3 (LTS)](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/releases/2.2.3/)

[Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/)

[JQuery](https://jquery.com/)

[AJAX](https://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/)


## Installation

The repository of our webpage could be found here: [https://github.com/susamusa29/trade_books_project/](https://github.com/susamusa29/trade_books_project/)

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
conda create -n tradebooks python=3.7.2
conda acitivate tradebooks
```

2. Clone our repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/susamusa29/trade_books_project/
```

3. Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Migrate database models:
```bash
cd trade_books_project
py manage.py makemigrations tradebooks
py manage.py migrate
```

5. Run the population script to populate the database for testing.
Note: python is used as "py " will not work and causes an error.
```bash
python population_script.py
```

6. Run the server
```bash
py manage.py runserver
```

## Unit Testing

To run a unit test
```bash
python manage.py test <test-file-name>
```

We have a total of five unit tests:

- tests
- tests_2
- tests_3
- tests_4,7
- tests_5,8

Run the code five times, replacing <test-file-name> with the name of the unit test file.

Note: Omit the file extension ".py" when unit testing.

## Usage

Five accounts are added by the population script, namely:
- desuderata
- okiTACObigtaco
- susamusa29
- abrar928
- NoobMaster69.

with "password" being the password for all five.
